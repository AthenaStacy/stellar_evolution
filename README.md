# stellar_evolution
This is a set of code and output designed to follow the evolution of a primoridal Pop III star.  In particular, it follows how the star 
changes in radius and luminosity over time as it accretes mass, where the accretion rate is a modifiable parameter, and the accretion 
geometry (spherical or disky) is a parameter as well.  The stellar evolution model here is based largely on models presented in 
Hosokawa et al 2010 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...721..478H).
